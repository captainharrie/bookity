# An 11ty Template For Authors

The goal with this template is to make it as easy as possible for an author to self-host their fiction, regardless of their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and webhosting. Will replace this with a step by step guide on how to set everything up later! The template is still being put together.

# To do:
### Customise Bootstrap 5.3 for specific 4.x syntax backwards compatability

Considering the nature of the website the template is built for, it is quite likely authors will wish to include cast pages with information on their characters. The [Toyhou.se](toyhou.se) community has created a lot of bootstrap templates for this purpose, but the TH website is using an older, customised version of bootstrap. The default configuration of BS5 will need to be edited to make these layouts compatible.

### Automatic Docx / RTF / ODT to Markdown/HTML conversion

Might not be able to get this one working, but if possible it would be a great QOL feature for authors if they could write in their usual writing software and have those files converted into pages for them.

### Compile Books to PDFs

This is not super high priority, but people might wish to include a PDF download for their works & I think this should be doable.
