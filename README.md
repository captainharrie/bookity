# An 11ty Template For Authors

The goal with this template is to make it as easy as possible for an author to self-host their fiction, regardless of their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and webhosting. I will walk you, the prospective author who wishes to use this template, through installing the dependencies and getting it set up so that all you need to do is save your chapters as markdown files and upload them to github, and then it will display those chapters on your netlify website, ready for people to read.
